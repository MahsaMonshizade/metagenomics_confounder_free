## Project Structure and Instructions

We are working with three datasets:

1. **MetaCardis** – Already included in the paper.
2. **IBS** – New dataset.
3. **CRC** – New dataset.

### Code Libraries

We have two libraries:

- **Fully Connected Network (FCNN)** – Located in `FCNN_lib/`
- **Confounder-Free Model** – Located in `FCNN_encoder_confounder_free_lib/`

Each library has its own `config.py` file. Inside these files, you’ll see that two datasets are currently commented out. To use a different dataset, **comment out the current one and uncomment the dataset you want to use**.

### Running the Code

To prepare the datasets: 

```bash
chmod +x prepare_dataset.sh
./prepare_dataset.sh
```

To run the models:

- For the **Fully Connected Network**:
```
  python FCNN_lib/main.py
```

- For the **Confounder-Free Model**:
```
  python FCNN_encoder_confounder_free_lib/main.py
```

- For the **Confounder-Free Model** with **pre-training**:
```
  python FCNN_encoder_confounder_free_lib/pretrain_main.py
  python FCNN_encoder_confounder_free_lib/finetune_main.py
```

- For the **MicroKPNN_Confounder-Free Model**:
*Yuhui: Add code to unzip files in Default_Database?*
```
  python MicroKPNN_encoder_confounder_free_lib/run_pipeline.py
  python MicroKPNN_encoder_confounder_free_lib/main.py
```

- For the **MicroKPNN_Confounder-Free Model** with **pre-training**:
```bash
  # run `python MicroKPNN_encoder_confounder_free_lib/run_pipeline.py` first
  cp -r Results/MicroKPNN_encoder_confounder_free_plots/required_data Results/MicroKPNN_encoder_confounder_free_finetune_plots/
  python MicroKPNN_encoder_confounder_free_lib/pretrain_main.py
  python MicroKPNN_encoder_confounder_free_lib/finetune_main.py
```

### Hyperparameter Optimization
We provide scripts to perform hyperparameter tuning:

For FCNN:
```
  python FCNN_lib/hyperparam_optimization.py
```

For Confounder_free
```
  python FCNN_encoder_confounder_free_lib/hyperparam_optimization.py
```

For MicroKPNN_Confounder_free
```
  python MicroKPNN_encoder_confounder_free_lib/run_pipeline.py
  python MicroKPNN_encoder_confounder_free_lib/hyperparam_optimization.py
```

Currently, the scripts are set to run 10 trials. You can increase this number as needed to improve optimization results.

## TODO List

1. Implement **early stopping** in the training process. (Mahsa)
2. ~~Add the last layer activatin funciton, latent dim, batch size and norm as hyper parameters (remove dropout as confounder parameter) (Mahsa)~~
3. ~~Try to find more crc data for pretraining they need to have gender (Mahsa)~~
4. ~~Add MicroKPNN confounder free (Mahsa)~~
5. ~~Clean MicroKPNN_Confounder_free_lib and create edges scripts (Mahsa)~~
6. Add EDA for each dataset (Mahsa)
7. Add explainability script (Mahsa)
8. ~~Add all benchmarks (MicroKPNN, SVM, RF) (Mahsa)~~
9. ~~Implement MicroKPNN-MT as a benchmark (Mahsa)~~
10. try our model on metacardis data again (Mahsa)
11. try to fine tune MicroKPNN_confounder_free (Mahsa)
12. try to fine tune FCNN_confounder_free (Mahsa)
13. try to fine tune microkpnn_mt and make sure the code is correct (Mahsa)

10. ~~Read train.py carefully (Yuhui)~~
11. ~~Pretraining on the wole crc dataset (Yuhui)~~
12. Early stop control (*Yuhui: I observed that different folds converge at different epochs, so an early stopping strategy needs to be implemented.*)
13. Make the configurations for different datasets been used separately

11. Try different loss function instead of pearson loss function
13. For the **CRC dataset**, remove **age** and **BMI** as they are potential confounders.
14. Plot pca and tsne on both train and test to see samples distribution
15. Data Augmentation (phylomix)
